# An Introduction to Terraform Sample Code

This repo contains the sample code for the blog post [An Introduction to
Terraform](https://blog.gruntwork.io/an-introduction-to-terraform-f17df9c6d180#.eo54nuvuj). It is broken down into two
folders:

* [single-web-server](./single-web-server): Deploy a single EC2 Instance with a web server that will return
  "Hello, World" for every request on port 8080.
* [cluster-of-web-servers](./cluster-of-web-servers): Deploy a cluster of EC2 Instances in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
  and an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). The ELB listens on port 80 and distributes load across the EC2 Instances, each
  of which runs the same "Hello, World" web server.

## Quick start

**Note**: These examples deploy resources into your AWS account. Although all the resources should fall under the
[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), it is not our responsibility if you are charged money for this.

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
1. Set your AWS credentials as the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
1. `cd` into one of the two example folders.
1. Run `terraform plan`.
1. If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply`.
